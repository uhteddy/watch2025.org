## Overview
Project 2025 prioritizes a **nationwide deportation initiative** that significantly expands federal enforcement efforts against undocumented immigrants. This includes **raids, workplace enforcement, and expedited removal proceedings.**

## Goals
- **Increase deportations** through expanded enforcement operations.
- **Utilize local and state law enforcement partnerships** to identify and detain undocumented individuals.
- **Streamline removal proceedings** by implementing expedited deportation measures.

## Implementation Progress
As of March 2025, mass deportation efforts are underway, with DHS reporting **a 50% increase in removal operations** since the initiative's launch.

## Challenges & Controversies
- **Legal opposition** from civil rights groups challenging the constitutionality of expanded deportation powers.
- **Concerns from local governments** opposing federal intervention in state law enforcement practices.
- **Humanitarian concerns** regarding family separations and detention conditions.

## Next Steps
- Increase ICE funding to facilitate further deportation efforts.
- Expand cooperation with state and local law enforcement under the 287(g) program.
- Explore additional legislative measures to streamline deportation policies.
