## Overview
Project 2025 includes a strong emphasis on **border security**, with a specific focus on completing the U.S.-Mexico border wall. This initiative aligns with past policy proposals and executive actions that emphasize a **tough stance on immigration** and **enhanced enforcement measures**.

## Goals
- **Complete border wall construction** to deter illegal crossings.
- **Deploy military and federal law enforcement** to reinforce border security.
- **Expand surveillance and technological monitoring** to track and prevent unlawful entries.

## Implementation Progress
As of March 2025, the initiative has seen **partial implementation**, with funding allocated for additional barriers and increased personnel presence at the border.

## Challenges & Controversies
- **Legal challenges** regarding the national emergency declaration.
- **Budget constraints** and potential opposition in Congress.
- **Human rights concerns** raised by advocacy groups.

## Next Steps
